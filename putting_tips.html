        Putting Tips <br />
        The Five "Musts" for Great Putting
      </h1>
      <div class="putting_guide__content">
        <h2>Tempo</h2>
        <p class="putting_tips__text">
          Tempo is the foundation of Touch and Targeting. Pick one and use it
          all the time. In picking one, recognize that the putter itself has its
          own tempo, which you can observe by simply letting it swing to and fro
          by itself holding the top of the grip lightly with your fingertips.
          Most putters have a tempo of about one second (60 beats per minute)
          from side to side, regardless of the length of the stroke. This
          "hitless" base tempo is about as smooth as you can get, and you do not
          power the stroke at all, but simply "ride the grip" as the putter
          falls in a natural gravity-sponsored acceleration into impact. If you
          choose this or another tempo, fine, but pay close attention to how the
          stroke's motion pattern going back to the top coasts to a stop and
          then changes direction and gradually and smoothly accelerates into
          impact. Duplicating this motion pattern in the follow-through is nice,
          and is better than worrying about making the stroke length's back and
          through match up. The tempo is about smooth, symmetric motion.
        </p>
        <h2>Touch</h2>
        <p class="putting_tips__text">
          Touch is distance control on different greens, so it starts with
          recognizing green speed. Once green speed is recognized, touch depends
          on a stable tempo and precise targeting for distance and uphill /
          downhill effects. The stable tempo allows your targeting to produce a
          backstroke (and thus a putter speed at impact) that factors in green
          speed for just the right "weight" (as the Brits say). Touch also
          depends upon the putter's design and weight and the type of ball, so
          changing these can affect your tempo and you'll need to adjust. The
          mental process for touch is instinctive, so don't try to manage it too
          closely -- just allow your adult movement skills to roll the ball all
          the way into the hole.
        </p>
        <h2>Targeting</h2>
        <p class="putting_tips__text">
          Targeting is your conscious and intuitive assessment of distance,
          starting direction, path shape, and energy pattern of the putt. Good
          targeting depends upon accurate physical procedures for generating
          perceptions that correspond with reality, as these perceptions will
          determine how the body makes the stroke. Assess distance both visually
          and physically during your "hunting" the read, and again once the
          address setup is adopted. Read the break backwards out of the hole,
          like a reverse movie, with accurate imagination of the speed of the
          roll near the cup. Follow this reverse break through the apex until it
          turns back more or less in a straight line to the ball's location at
          address. Pick a target or aim spot that is a little higher than aiming
          for the apex or break point, as the ball will break at least a little
          before it reaches the apex, and at the apex the direction of roll is
          changing from uphill to downhill. Target the startline at this aim
          spot from behind the ball with your dominant eye on the line, and then
          walk the line into the ball for accurate putterface placement and
          careful alignment. Adopt your grip and setup only after the putterface
          is aligned properly. From beside the ball, check the alignment for
          squareness through the ball to the target using a gaze that is
          straight out of the face, and not with eyes looking down the nose or
          cheeks. When ready to pull the trigger, return again to your sense of
          distance and your visualization of the final 2 or 3 feet of the putt's
          path, and send the ball off so it enters this last piece of the putt
          with proper energy to sink.
        </p>
        <h2>Technique</h2>
        <p class="putting_tips__text">
          Technique is making a straight stroke out of a square setup that
          consistently sends the ball straight away with a good roll and maximum
          energy transfer at impact. Setup to the ball-putterface relation by
          using the putterface orientation through the ball as the line to
          square the feet up to, and then the hips and shoulders. Play the ball
          about two inches forward of the middle of your body (off the heart for
          right-handers), and place the putter's sweetspot aimed straight
          through the ball's center, with the sole of the putter flush to the
          surface. Soling the putter correctly insures you setup your body to
          the surface, rather than to gravity. Once the body is square to this
          putterface orientation, check to make sure you're actually aimed at
          the target, and if not, adjust the putterface accordingly and reset
          the body as a unit (feet and all) to the new putterface orientation.
          Or recycle the whole aiming process from behind the ball. Once
          satisfied with the face alignment and squareness of setup, note the
          spot directly out from the big toe of the forward foot that is on the
          startline and commit to a stroke movement that rolls the ball out of
          the setup over this line for every single putt. Make the backstroke go
          straight back or at worst slightly inside back, but NEVER allow the
          sweetspot to travel outside the putt's startline going back. Keep the
          hands and elbows moving as if sliding along a rail aimed parallel to
          the starline, and keep the grip pressure established at address
          constant throughout the stroke movement. Keep your body's pivot still
          during the stroke, and make sure the sole returns to flush in the
          middle of your stance and keep your hands as low as they started and
          allow the putterhead to rise ever so slightly on its own arc into the
          back of the ball.
        </p>
        <h2>Psychology</h2>
        <p class="putting_tips__text">
          Psychology is easy. If you don't know how to do the above, then learn.
          If thinking too much or your emotions interfere with your putting,
          then don't think and don't care. Find a point in the cycle of your
          routine to banish thinking and emotion from that point forward. The
          brain in controlling movement to a target needs all the resources for
          staying in the moment of the space of the green, and thinking or
          emotional turmoil hurts performance. So get calm and clear in mind and
          then continue the routine and just do what you know needs to be done
          to give the putt its best chance of sinking.
