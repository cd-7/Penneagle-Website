                ><br /><br />Over the years I have used many putters with
                varying success. I like my Palisade mallet TPD.3V. The putter
                has a good feel and response. The Penneagle Alignment Guides
                easily aid in Aligning my ball and Squaring the Putter Face at
                Address.

              ><br /><br />Back in January of this year, I was able to attend
              the PGA Show in Orlando, FL. During my two days that I spent at
              the show, I had tried nearly every putter by nearly every
              manufacturer. I was not impressed with any putter until I tried
              your Palisade TPD.3V Putter. This putter had the greatest feel of
              any putter that I have ever tried. Unfortunately, the putter was
              not available at that time.<br /><br />
              Recently I purchased your Palisade TPD.3V Putter. I have played in
              three tournaments using this putter. I have never had more
              confidence in any golf club in my bag. Putting use to be my main
              weakness in my game. In the three rounds of tournament golf I had
              28, 29, and 28 putts.<br /><br />
              I have also played two other rounds of golf in Nashville, putting
              on Bent Grass Greens. There I had 27 and 28 putts. Without a
              doubt, this is by far the most perfectly balanced putter on the
              market. When you use this putter, you can feel the pendulum action
              and the incredible balance. Thank you all for making available
              this putter. If anyone would like to talk to me about this putter,
              please feel free to give them my name and number.

              ><br /><br />I received the putter on Friday and took it out on
              Saturday. Loved it. Absolutely loved it. The head is smaller than
              I had anticipated which really gave me the compact feeling I was
              looking for in a putter. This combined with the INCREDIBLE
              weighting made it feel like I was "putting on rails." I had a true
              roll every putt; I really like how the ball comes off the face. I
              was continually fighting the springiness of my white hot, but this
              putter just glides the ball away from the club.

              ><br /><br />I recently bought this putter and am very satisfied.
              This is not only a great looking putter, it is also extremely
              accurate. The weighting and alignment system gives me the
              confidence I need to make those tricky 6-8 foot putts. The ball
              comes off the face very smoothly and has great feel. This is an
              excellent putter.

              ><br /><br />I recently purchased the Palisade center shafted
              putter and played my first round. Great Putter!! The balance of
              weighting in the putter head allowed me to keep the putter face
              square through the putt. Keeping the face square allowed me to hit
              each putt along the line for which I aimed. Liked the feel and it
              has excellent speed control. I shaved 5 strokes off my putting in
              the first round with the Palisade in the bag. Very forgiving
              putter!

              ><br /><br />Putting is the best part of my game and I have tested
              hundreds of putters. My best analysis would be as follows. Very
              easy to line up and probably the best I have seen as far as
              accuracy. Truly rolls the ball on line. The greens at our club are
              very fast so the heavyweight model is perfect!

              ><br /><br />I purchased this TPD.4 putter in March 2005 and have
              been using it for 2 months now. I really love the feel of the
              putter, the easy alignment, its accuracy and to top it off it
              looks great. This TPD.4 Penneagle putter is far superior to the
              Never Compromise TDP center shafted mallet putter that it
              replaced. I have never felt this much confidence when I reach the
              greens!

              ><br /><br />In 1965, after one year of a very unsuccessful
              attempt at college, I turned Professional in Golf. There is no
              doubt that thirty nine years later, I had made the right
              decision.<br /><br />
              I have always been known as an excellent ball striker. Growing up
              and working for several years on a 125 year old Donald Ross
              magnificent golf course, small greens made me a pin seeker and
              soft beautifully manicured greens allowed me to hit it close and
              make it stop! <br /><br />However, with a lot of practice in
              hitting it close, I definitely didn't spend the proper time and
              effort on putting. I was without a doubt, the best ball striker
              and most lousy putter in the New England section.<br /><br />
              I'm not absolutely sure, but I'll bet that the only person in
              professional golf with more putters than me, was The King, Arnold
              Palmer. This comparison to Mr. Palmer is the only time that I'll
              use his name in the same paragraph with mine.<br /><br />
              Yet, at the 2004 PGA Show, I had the great fortune of being
              introduced to Penneagle. This is the first and only putter that
              when placed in my hands, takes away all the old memories of all
              the missed 4-5 footers that I was so fondly known for!<br /><br />
              The Penneagle Palisade is great to look at, fun to use and above
              all, the precision construction and weighting system allows me to
              stoke it pure and positively fearless!!<br /><br />
              Balance, heel/toe and back weighting has allowed me to feel the
              stroke instead of wondering where I'll be putting from next. In
              recent professional events, it has been just remarkable and the
              tougher the greens the better! In the 5 months that I have been
              using the Palisade my putting average went from 29-31 to 26-27
              putts per round. This has given me a decisive advantage in tour
              play!!
